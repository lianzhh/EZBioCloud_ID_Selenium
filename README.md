## chrome driver installation
ChromeDriver is a separate executable that Selenium WebDriver uses to control Chrome. Follow these steps to setup your tests for running with Chrome Driver:
1) Determine the version number of browser
In the address bar, enter > chrome://settings/help
2) Chrome Driver expects you have Chrome installed in the default location for your platform, otherwise you can force ChromeDriver to use a custom location by setting a special capability.
```
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.setBinary("/path/to/other/chrome/binary");
```
3) Download the ChromeDriver binary for your platform under the downloads section of [this site](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).
